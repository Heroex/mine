  Good:
  
    - LODÂ´s
    - maybe more controls on the player's movement - in Tick()
    - low resolution of textures
    - ideal settings for post process - ray tracing for example
    
  Bad:
  
    - avoid of network code running every tick
    - a lot of nodes in BP
    - complex audio effects
    - bad materials
